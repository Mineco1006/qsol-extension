## Safety information

QSol is still in an early phase of development, retrieving your seeds after adding them is not yet implemented. Updating might delete your local storage and thus your seeds, so please keep them safe seperately!

## Which RPCs can I use?

The browser extension currently ships with a default RPC provided by our team, to run your own RPC check out https://github.com/Mineco1006/qubic-utils where both windows and linux x86-64 version of the current RPC version are available as release and source code (portable).
